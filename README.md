# Technical Design Document
# VR Job Interview Practice Application for Oculus Quest

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical design for a VR job interview practice application built for the Oculus Quest. The application will leverage an LLM-powered interviewer connected via USB Link to a PC to provide realistic interview scenarios, dynamic conversations, and real-time feedback to help users improve their interview skills.

## 1. Core Functionality

### 1.1 LLM-Powered Virtual Interviewers

#### Natural Conversation System
- The application will use a bidirectional communication pipeline between the Quest and PC to enable natural conversation flow.
- The LLM will maintain a context window containing:
  - Interview scenario details
  - User profile information
  - Conversation history
  - Interviewer personality parameters
  - Current interview progress status

#### Adaptive Questioning
- The LLM will analyze user responses using NLP techniques to:
  - Detect answer quality and relevance
  - Identify missed opportunities in responses
  - Track conversation topics to ensure comprehensive coverage
  - Adjust difficulty based on user performance

```csharp
// Interview state management
public class InterviewStateManager
{
    private float currentDifficulty;
    private List<string> coveredTopics = new List<string>();
    private List<string> plannedTopics = new List<string>();
    private Dictionary<string, float> userPerformanceMetrics = new Dictionary<string, float>();
    
    public void AdjustDifficultyBasedOnPerformance(float responseQualityScore)
    {
        // Dynamically adjust difficulty based on user's performance
        currentDifficulty = Mathf.Clamp(
            currentDifficulty + (responseQualityScore > 0.7f ? 0.1f : -0.05f),
            0.3f, 0.9f
        );
        
        // Update LLM context with new difficulty parameter
        InterviewLLMConnector.Instance.UpdateContextParameter("difficulty", currentDifficulty);
    }
    
    public string GetNextTopicBasedOnProgress()
    {
        // Select next topic based on coverage and performance
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Interviewer Personalities and Styles
- Multiple interviewer personalities will be available:
  - Technical Interviewer (focuses on skills, technical questions)
  - Behavioral Interviewer (focuses on past experiences, soft skills)
  - Stress Interviewer (challenges responses, creates pressure)
  - Conversational Interviewer (friendly, collaborative approach)
- Each personality will have distinct:
  - Voice characteristics
  - Animation patterns
  - Question styles
  - Follow-up tendencies
  - Custom 3D models with unique appearances

### 1.2 Realistic Office Environments

- Three distinct environmental themes:
  - Corporate (formal office with modern design, city views)
  - Startup (open-plan office with casual elements)
  - Casual (comfortable setting with relaxed atmosphere)
- Each environment will feature:
  - Ambient audio specific to the setting
  - Interactive elements (whiteboards, screens for presentations)
  - Dynamic lighting to match time of day
  - NPCs in background for realism (optional, configurable)

### 1.3 Voice Recognition and Analysis

- Integration with Windows Speech Recognition API on PC side
- Voice data capture through Quest microphone
- Process pipeline:
  1. Audio captured on Quest
  2. Transmitted to PC for processing
  3. Speech-to-text conversion
  4. Text sent to LLM for understanding
  5. Voice metrics extracted (pace, volume, clarity)

```csharp
// Voice capture and analysis component
public class VoiceCapture : MonoBehaviour
{
    private AudioClip recordingClip;
    private bool isRecording = false;
    private float[] samplingBuffer;
    private int sampleRate = 44100;
    
    public void StartRecording()
    {
        isRecording = true;
        recordingClip = Microphone.Start(null, false, 60, sampleRate);
    }
    
    public void StopRecordingAndProcess()
    {
        isRecording = false;
        Microphone.End(null);
        
        // Get audio data
        samplingBuffer = new float[recordingClip.samples * recordingClip.channels];
        recordingClip.GetData(samplingBuffer, 0);
        
        // Send to PC for processing
        PCCommunicationManager.Instance.SendAudioData(samplingBuffer, sampleRate);
    }
}
```

### 1.4 Real-time Feedback System

#### Body Language Analysis
- Track head movement using Quest's built-in tracking
- Track hand gestures and positioning with Quest hand tracking
- Monitor posture and detect nervous movements

#### Eye Contact Analysis
- Track eye gaze direction using Quest eye tracking (if available)
- Calculate percentage of time spent making eye contact
- Detect wandering gaze patterns

#### Speech Pattern Analysis
- Analyze speech for filler words ("um", "like", "you know")
- Measure speaking pace (words per minute)
- Detect voice tremors indicating nervousness
- Analyze volume variations

#### Feedback Visualization
- Subtle real-time indicators during interview (optional)
- Comprehensive post-interview dashboard
- Heat maps showing gaze patterns
- Graphs for speech metrics
- Video playback with annotations

### 1.5 Progress Tracking and Analytics

- User profile system with interview history
- Performance metrics tracked across sessions:
  - Question handling proficiency
  - Body language improvement
  - Speech quality progress
  - Confidence measurement
- Graphical representation of improvement over time
- Interview recording playback with annotations
- Skill gap identification and recommended focus areas

#### Latency Management Strategies
- Asynchronous message processing
- Response pre-fetching for common questions
- Local caching of frequently used responses
- Compression for large data transfers (audio)
- Prioritization system for critical data packets
- Custom prediction system for interviewer responses

#### Fallback Options
- Local simplified conversational AI as backup
- Cached interview questions for offline mode
- Graceful degradation of features based on connection quality
- Auto-resume functionality when connection is restored
- Local storage of session data for later synchronization

### 2.4 LLM Integration

#### Recommended LLM Options

| LLM Option | Pros | Cons | Implementation |
|------------|------|------|----------------|
| Local (Llama 3 8B/70B) | Low latency, No API costs, Privacy | Higher hardware requirements, Limited capabilities | Run on PC using llama.cpp |
| Claude 3 Sonnet API | High quality responses, Specialized knowledge | API costs, Internet dependency | REST API integration |
| OpenAI GPT-4o mini API | Good balance of quality/speed, Strong reasoning | API costs, Internet dependency | REST API integration |
| Hybrid approach | Best of both worlds, Fallback options | Implementation complexity | Use local for quick responses, API for complex ones |

#### Prompt Engineering for Interview Context

The system will use carefully crafted prompts to guide the LLM:

```
You are an [INTERVIEWER_TYPE] interviewer conducting a job interview for a [POSITION] position.
Your name is [INTERVIEWER_NAME] and you work at [COMPANY_NAME].
The candidate's name is [CANDIDATE_NAME].

Interview Context:
- This is a [INTERVIEW_ROUND] round interview focusing on [FOCUS_AREAS]
- The candidate's experience level is [EXPERIENCE_LEVEL]
- Current interview difficulty level: [DIFFICULTY_LEVEL]

Your conversation style should be [CONVERSATION_STYLE].
You should ask questions that are relevant to the position and adjust based on the candidate's responses.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Ask one question at a time
2. Allow the candidate to finish their thoughts
3. Provide appropriate follow-up questions based on their responses
4. If the candidate gives a vague answer, ask for specific examples
5. Maintain a professional demeanor at all times
6. Do not reveal that you are an AI - act as a human interviewer would

Previous conversation:
[CONVERSATION_HISTORY]

Current state: [CURRENT_STATE]
```

This template will be filled dynamically based on the selected interview scenario and current state.

#### Managing Context Window and Conversation History

- Sliding window approach to maintain relevant conversation history
- Importance-based filtering to prioritize critical exchanges
- Periodic summarization of earlier parts of the conversation
- State tracking to maintain coherence without full history
- Dynamic prompt construction based on current interview phase

#### Optimizing Response Time

- Response caching for common questions
- Parallel processing of audio and text inputs
- Pre-generation of likely follow-up questions
- Progressive response streaming (start displaying responses as they're generated)
- Asynchronous processing pipeline to minimize blocking operations

### 2.5 Performance Optimization

#### GPU Utilization
- LOD (Level of Detail) system for complex environments
- Dynamic resolution scaling based on scene complexity
- Occlusion culling optimization for office environments
- GPU instancing for repeated office elements

#### Memory Management
- Asset streaming for different interview scenarios
- Texture atlas optimization for character models
- Memory pooling for frequently used objects
- Progressive loading of environment details

#### CPU Optimization
- Multithreading for non-Unity operations (audio processing, data serialization)
- Job System utilization for parallel processing
- Burst compilation for performance-critical code
- Minimal Update() method usage in idle components

#### Network Optimization
